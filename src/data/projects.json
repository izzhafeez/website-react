In essences, users can create and format their notes using our custom markdown editor, edit them, and publish them for others to see. Users can also search for notes created by others, with the option to upvote, downvote or favourite the note. If users want to make their own small edits to notes creatd by others, they can 'fork' from them, similar to GitHUb's system. Finally, this is surrounded by a credit system which encourages users to actively contribute to the platform."
