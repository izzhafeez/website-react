For every correct guess you make, a new service is added to this question bank. If you want a different set of options, you can just refresh the page.\nTry to get as many correct in a row. For every 5 correct guesses in a row, the number of options increases by 1. If you guess wrongly, your streak ends, and everything is reset.\nIf you change difficulty, everything is also reset."
