# React Personal Website

This is the current version of my website, using the React library as my frontend. It features some of the works I've done, the merites I've attained, and a blog where I share some of my experiences.

It contains many other projects within it, accessed through different subpages in the site. Some preprocessing of the JS Scripts and data were done in Rust, Python and Ruby.
